    "An airline industry measure of a passenger airline's capacity is the [available seat miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Available_seat_miles), which is equal to the number of seats available multiplied by the number of miles or kilometers flown summed over all flights. \n",
    "\n",

After completing all the necessary data wrangling steps, the resulting data frame should have 16 rows (one for each airline) and 2 columns (airline name and available seat miles). Here are some hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Crucial**: Unless you are very confident in what you are doing, it is worthwhile to not starting coding right away, but rather first sketch out on paper all the necessary data wrangling steps not using exact code, but rather high-level *pseudocode* that is informal yet detailed enough to articulate what you are doing. This way you won't confuse *what* you are trying to do (the algorithm) with *how* you are going to do it (writing `dplyr` code). \n",
